<h1>The Series Has Landed</h1>
<p>Calculon is gonna kill us and it's all everybody else's fault! Ah, yes! John Quincy Adding Machine.  He struck a chord with the voters when he pledged not to go on a killing spree. Ven ve voke up, ve had zese wodies.</p>
<h2>Leela's Homeworld</h2>
<p>No, she'll probably make me do it. My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book 'Earth in the Balance'', and the much more popular ''Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth', we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards. You are the last hope of the universe. Michelle, I don't regret this, but I both rue and lament it. Enough about your promiscuous mother, Hermes! We have bigger problems.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ugh, it's filthy! Why not create a National Endowment for Strip Clubs while we're at it?</li>
<li>Enough about your promiscuous mother, Hermes! We have bigger problems.</li>
<li>Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here.</li>
<li>Morbo will now introduce tonight's candidates&hellip; PUNY HUMAN NUMBER ONE, PUNY HUMAN NUMBER TWO, and Morbo's good friend, Richard Nixon.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Time Keeps on Slippin'</h3>
<p>Hey, you add a one and two zeros to that or we walk! And yet you haven't said what I told you to say! How can any of us trust you? You won't have time for sleeping, soldier, not with all the bed making you'll be doing.</p>
<h4>A Leela of Her Own</h4>
<p>You wouldn't. Ask anyway! Wow, you got that off the Internet? In my day, the Internet was only used to download pornography. I'm Santa Claus! Then throw her in the laundry room, which will hereafter be referred to as "the brig".</p>
<ol>
<li>Wow, you got that off the Internet? In my day, the Internet was only used to download pornography.</li>
<li>Fetal stemcells, aren't those controversial?</li>
<li>You don't know how to do any of those.</li>
<li>And until then, I can never die?</li>
</ol>
<h5>Spanish Fry</h5>
<p>I found what I need. And it's not friends, it's things. No, she'll probably make me do it. You're going back for the Countess, aren't you?</p>
